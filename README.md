# myportfolio

This is my portfolio project bootstrapped with Create React App. It showcases my projects and skills.  

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
